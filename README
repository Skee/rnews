RNews
=====

RNews is a simple interface to a Simple Machines Forum (SMF) database that grabs:
- the first post of each thread in a given board
- the number of replies to each thread
- the first line of each post made to a certain thread by a certain user

It also generates links to the specific posts/threads extracted.

It is designed to be used as a simple news-displaying front page, a la TinyPortal.
