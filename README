RNews
=====

RNews is a simple interface to a Simple Machines Forum (SMF) database that
grabs:
- the first post of each thread in a given board
- the number of replies to each thread
- the subject of each post made to a certain thread by a certain user

It also generates links to the specific posts/threads extracted.

It is designed to be used as a simple news-displaying front page, a la
TinyPortal.

Also included is a basic converter for wordpress posts to smf topics,
and a htaccess generator for redirects from wordpress posts to smf topics.

The generated output is cached in one file per page. You must configure page
caches in a webserver writable directory. Appropriate headers are also sent
to the browser in order to minimize traffic.
