blagporter:

- SMF breaks on HTML using single instead of double quotes in tags/attributes
  => make sure all your img and a tags use "url" instead of 'url'

- blagporter does not create entries for topics in smf_topics => after
  blagporting, go to Forum Maintenance and hit Fix Errors (choose Yes after the
  errors are listed) and Recount Totals and Statistics

- blag comments are imported as guest-made forum posts and not linked to
  existing forum profiles (if existing) => live with it.
