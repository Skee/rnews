blagporter:

- SMF breaks on HTML using single instead of double quotes in tags/attributes
  => make sure all your img and a tags use "url" instead of 'url'
  => there are some sql queries commented at the end of blagporter, read them

- blagporter does not create all of SMF's entries for new topics/posts => after
  blagporting, go to Forum Maintenance and hit Fix Errors (choose Yes after the
  errors are listed) and Recount Totals and Statistics

- blag comments are imported as guest-made forum posts and not linked to
  existing forum profiles (if existing) => live with it.

- newlines in the original post's HTML are converted to br tags by SMF when
  displaying => remove any extraneous newlines from the posts to make them
  display cleanly.
